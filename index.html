        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I am a 28 year old student at the University of Windsor, currently in my third year of the Bachelor's in
            Computer Science- Applied Computing program. I previously completed a Kinesiology Bachelor's degree at 
            the University of Windsor and graduated in 2017. I played football for the Lancers on a scholarship for 3 years
            during my first tenure at UWindsor.
        </p>
        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <p>I was born and raised and Windsor, and play lacrosse professionally in the National Lacrosse League, 
            which I have done since 2015. I have played in Calgary, Buffalo, and San Diego throughout my 
            career. Thankfully this career gives me plenty of free time to continue pursuing education as I look to 
            transition into the computer science field. I have also worked in personal training, yoga instructing, 
            bartending, and audio engineering which gives me a wide range of soft skills that are applicable in many workplace
            environments.

            <h3>Covid Database</h3>
            <p>I created a COVID-19 database using SQL along with 2 other University of Windsor students.
                This database contained Provincial and Municipal information including:

            <h3>Car Factory</h3>
            <p>Designed and coded in Java a basic outline for a car factory that would create various types of vehicles. This project is more
                a showcase of my skills in higher level organization and design, as well as undestanding of the OOA->OOP->OOD process and how to
                model real world situations and implement them in code.
