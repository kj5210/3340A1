Kellen LeClair- Project Portfolio Website

The purpose of this project portfolio website is to give a background on some of my skills and life experience as well as an overview of some of the things I've worked on thus far in the computer science field.

The features include an about me section, a project section, and responsive design implemented in CSS to fit 4 different sizes of screens that are commonly used. The project contains an index.html file which handles the structure of the website, 2 photos, and a1.css which handles the styling of the website.
